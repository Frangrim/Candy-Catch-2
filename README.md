This is an update to the original Candy Catch game that includes the following new features:

- A streak system that replenishes a life point on five successful catches
- Vegetables that reduce the score and reset the steak if the player eats them
- New UI elements such as the spinning 2 on the title screen and text changing to red when the score is reduced or the streak is broken
